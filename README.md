# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Plant Leaf Disease Detection project leverages deep learning to identify and classify plant diseases with pixel-level precision. Using Mask R-CNN, this model can accurately segment and detect affected regions, aiding in early disease detection and effective crop management.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… Mask R-CNN for pixel-wise segmentation
âœ… Custom dataset handling for plant disease images and masks
âœ… Deep learning-powered classification
âœ… Potential applications in smart agriculture

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
